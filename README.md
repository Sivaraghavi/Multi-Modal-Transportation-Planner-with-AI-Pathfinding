# Multi-Modal Transportation Planner with AI Pathfinding

## Description
This project optimizes route planning for driving, walking, and bicycling using AI algorithms. It integrates real-time traffic data and public transport schedules, comparing Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to enhance urban navigation. Interactive maps visualize efficient routes based on user preferences.

## Features
- Route planning using Dijkstra's and A* algorithms
- Integration of real-time traffic data
- Public transport schedule fetching
- Visualization of routes on interactive maps
- Comparison of algorithm performance
