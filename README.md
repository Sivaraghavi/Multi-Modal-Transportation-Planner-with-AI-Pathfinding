# Multi-Modal-Transportation-Planner-with-AI-Pathfinding
This project optimizes route planning for driving, walking, and bicycling using AI algorithms. It integrates real-time traffic data and public transport schedules, comparing Dijkstra's and A* algorithms to enhance urban navigation. Interactive maps visualize efficient routes based on user preferences.
